# Effective Altruism USC

We are a group of Trojans who share a common drive to do the most good we can with our resources. We think about the principles of [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) and apply them to discussions and projects.

### Some questions we think about:
How can we do good more efficiently?
What kinds of problems should we prioritize?
What counts as "good" in the first place?

### Some topics we focus on:
Existential risks
Emerging technologies
Animal welfare
Global health and development
Career and impact
Policy and governance

### Some things we do:
Discussions on big questions
Learning about intriguing subjects
Workshops for honing thinking habits
Projects for practical impact
Mutual support for our goals

We meet every other Monday at 6:30 PM PT. All are welcome to join us!
